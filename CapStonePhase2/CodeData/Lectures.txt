1)
Variables & Datatypes

Variables are a way to store a type of data and use it for another purpose within an application. To declare a variable, there are a few types of variables to use: 'string' and 'char' both use text and will require using double quotes (" ") within the value of the variable, but 'char' will only store one character. Use 'int,' 'double,' and 'float' for any numerical data, but 'int' only allows whole numbers. 'bool' can be used to determine if something fits one of two cases: true or false. Name the variable after declaring its type, and it is best practice to name it a noun, although the keywords are not able to be variable names. When declaring a variable, you can set the value to Console.Readline() to allow any user input to be the value. 

Ex:
string FirstName = "Zack";
int age = 20;
bool IsSingle = true;

User Input example:
string UserInput = Console.Readline();


What are Variables. What are datatypes? Provide an example of a datatype.

Declare one of every data type shown within the description and give each variable an appropriate value.

2)
Flow Control

Flow Control is used for allowing a user to go through certain parts of code due to specific conditions. Think of them as choices in everyday life. In C#, we use two forms of flow control: If statements and switch cases. The 'if' keyword is used to execute code if the condition provided is true. If the condition is false, we can use 'if...else' to provide a default condition if any other if statement is considered false. We can also use 'if...else if' statements to provide multiple conditions within code. In the code example, we use the mathematical operators of greater than (>), less than (<), equal to (==), greater than or equal to (>=), or less than or equal to (<=) in order to determine if a condition is true or false.

Ex:
int age = 20; 
if (age < 25)
{ Console.WriteLine("Still Young")
}
else if (age >= 25)
{ Console.WriteLine("Feeling old yet?")}
else
{
Console.WriteLine("Error.")
}

What is the purpose of an if statement when using flow control? 


Create an if statement to create at two or more different outcomes based upon an age criteria.
